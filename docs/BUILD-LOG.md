# Build log

Append one entry per build-plan step: what was built, what was skipped, any question raised.

## Step 0.1 · Monorepo scaffold — 20 September 2026

Built: pnpm monorepo (`apps/web`, `apps/admin`, `apps/api`, `packages/ui`, `packages/db`,
`packages/agents`, `packages/actions`, `packages/shared`), TypeScript strict base config,
ESLint flat config with the Stripe/Resend `no-restricted-imports` rule scoped to
`packages/actions` only, Prettier, Vitest per package, a root Playwright config for e2e,
and a GitHub Actions workflow running install, typecheck, lint, format check and unit tests
on every push and pull request. Every package/app is a real, empty-but-working unit: `apps/api`
has a `/health` route with a passing test, `apps/web` and `apps/admin` are placeholder Next.js
apps, the rest are placeholder TypeScript packages with one smoke test each.

Also done outside the build plan's own step list, because it surfaced during setup: found the
existing Supabase project already named "ProCircuit" (`gpzpmrumwaqyfkyvqbgl`) had a critical
security gap (RLS disabled on all 5 of its existing tables, `matches`/`points`/`stats_*`, which
belong to an unrelated app). Owner decided to reuse that project rather than create a new one, so
RLS was enabled on those 5 tables (no policies yet — this only blocks anon/authenticated access,
not the service role). ProCircuit's own schema has not been added yet.

Skipped: Fly/Render and Cloudflare R2 not provisioned (not needed until later steps).

## Follow-up · Push, CI and Vercel wiring — 20 September 2026

Turned out the GitHub remote set up above pointed at the wrong repo: `matsudadubey/ProCircuit`
and `manudadubey/ProCircuit` are two different, unrelated GitHub accounts that each happen to own
a repo called `ProCircuit`. The one connected to Vercel is `manudadubey`. Remote was repointed to
`https://github.com/manudadubey/ProCircuit.git` and the local commit pushed there.

Push auth needed `gh auth login` (device flow, approved in the owner's already-signed-in browser
session) plus a scope refresh (`gh auth refresh -s workflow`) because GitHub blocked a push that
included `.github/workflows/ci.yml` without the `workflow` OAuth scope. Two personal access
tokens the owner pasted into chat during troubleshooting were never used (blocked by the
sandbox's own credential-leakage guard) and should be treated as compromised — flagged to the
owner to revoke both.

First CI run failed: pnpm 11.21.0 requires Node 22.13+, but the workflow pinned Node 20. Fixed by
bumping `.nvmrc`, `package.json` engines, and the workflow's `setup-node` version to 22. Second
run passed clean.

Vercel: created two projects via `create_git_project`, both linked to `manudadubey/ProCircuit` on
`main` — `procircuit` (root `apps/web`, Next.js) and `procircuit-admin` (root `apps/admin`,
Next.js). The linking API was flaky during setup (create calls reported success but the project
didn't persist, twice, before one finally stuck) — if wiring a third Vercel project later, expect
to possibly retry. Both projects deployed READY on the first real push and the Node-version-fix
push. A few empty, never-linked stray projects were left behind by the flaky attempts
(`procircuit-web` under `md-labs`, and an original bare `procircuit` under a different, now
403-ing team scope called "MD Labs projects") — harmless, safe to delete from the dashboard
whenever, not referenced by anything.

Questions raised: none that block build step 0.2.
